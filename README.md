## Documentation

We use mkdocs to create the public version of our tutorials (notebooks) and the API documentation. mkdocs are written in 
Markdown and are found in `docs/`.
You can view your local version with `mkdocs serve` in `labproject/` and then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/. This especially 
helpful when editing the documentation.

### Notebooks
The jupyter notebooks are found in `docs/notebooks/`
